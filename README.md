# Stargate RPG System for FoundryVTT

This is a FoundryVTT system for playing the Stargate RPG made by Wyvern Gaming.

Rules can be purchased from
[https://stargatetherpg.com](https://stargatetherpg.com/) or
[modiphius.net](https://modiphius.net/products/stargate-sg-1-roleplaying-game-core-rulebook)

These rules are mostly abandoned or frozen due to Amazon's purchase of MGM, but
an effort has been made to make them roughly playable on Foundry.

following URL into the Install System dialog on the Setup menu of the
